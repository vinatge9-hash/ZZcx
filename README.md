# Niyantran Coffee - Website

This project is a fully client-side, static website for a coffee shop named Niyantran. It includes multiple pages, a default menu, a simple cart system, and a mock Stripe checkout flow for demonstration.

Files:
- index.html: Home page with hero, features, testimonials, and links to other pages.
- about.html: Founders and mission details.
- contact.html: Simple contact form.
- menu.html: Default menu items with “Add to Cart” actions.
- chart.html: Cart view to review items and adjust quantities.
- checkout.html: Mock Stripe payment flow with client-side validation and simulated API.
- README.md: This file.

Notes:
- All pages use Tailwind CSS via CDN and are built with fluid, full-width layouts.
- Images use the required placeholder syntax, e.g. https://images.pexels.com/photos/1524336/pexels-photo-1524336.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940.
- The main content stretches full width; no fixed-width containers are used for the main sections.
